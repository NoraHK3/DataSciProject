# Saudi Food Cuisine Multilabel Classification

## Project Overview
This is a Data Science project that focuses on **multilabel classification of Saudi cuisine dishes**.  
The goal is to build a machine learning model capable of detecting and labeling **multiple food components within a single dish** (e.g., rice, meat, vegetables, bread).  
Unlike traditional single-label classification, each dish may contain **several items at the same time**, and the model should recognize all of them.  

This project supports:
- **Ingredient-level recognition** for dietary analysis.  
- **Cultural food studies** by analyzing how Saudi dishes are composed.  
- Potential future applications in **nutrition tracking**, **restaurant automation**, and **food recommendation systems**.



##  Project Description
- **Main Objective**:  
  Develop a multilabel classification model that can identify **all relevant food items in one dish image**.  

- **Brief**:  
  The model should predict categories such as **Rice, Meat, Chicken, Bread, Salad, Drinks, Desserts, Sides**, etc. For example, if the dish contains *rice + salad + chicken*, all three labels should be assigned.
